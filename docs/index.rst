Welcome to the xarray-validate documentation!


Motivation
----------

This is a maintained refactor of
`xarray-schema <https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-schema>`_.
I needed an xarray validation engine for one of my projects. I saw in the
xarray-schema library a good start, but both its maintenance status and the
foreseen integration of its feature set into the much larger Pandera library
seemed uncertain. I therefore decided to fork the project, refactor it and add
the features I was missing.

Features
--------

* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è DataArray and Dataset validation
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Basic Python type serialization / deserialization
* Construct schema from existing xarray data
* üö´ JSON roundtrip (not guaranteed to work)

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Inherited from xarray-schema
üö´ Won't do / won't fix

Installation
------------

Required dependencies:

* Python 3.8 or later
* xarray 2024 or later

Install from PyPI in your virtual environment:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install xarray-validate

Available extras:

* ``dask``: Validate xarrays with dask arrays.
* ``yaml``: Load schemas from YAML files.

To install all extras:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install "xarray-validate[all]"
